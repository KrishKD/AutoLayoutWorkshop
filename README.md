#Auto Layout Workshop

##Profile

- Profile picture should always be square.
- Profile picture should take up 1/3 of the screen width. Name, location and blurb should fill the remaining 2/3 of the screen width.
- Profile picture should be centred vertically with the text to its right (name, location, blurb), unless the text is too tall for the picture in which case the image should be aligned to the top of the text.
- Social icons should be evenly spaced across the full width of the screen
- The name of the cafe should truncate if too long, but the date should not truncate.
- Text field should fill the available width

##Take Photo

- Bottom tool bar should have a height constraint equal to 90.
- Camera guidelines should always be square. On short screens (iPhone 4S) the guidelines have more space on the left and right sides, on tall screens (iPhone 6 Plus) there is more space above and below the guidelines.
